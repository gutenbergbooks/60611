  <h2 id='ch01' class='c007'>Chapter One<br /> <br />ALARMING NEWS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>The Teenie Weenies had known for some time that a
tribe of tiny wild men lived in a big swamp many
teenie weenie miles from the shoe house. Field mice and
birds had carried the news of these strange little people
to the Teenie Weenies. The wild men lived in the heart
of a big forest and they spoke a language quite different
from the Teenie Weenies.</p>

<p class='c004'>“These wild men are very cruel,” a friendly bird told
the Teenie Weenies. “They are called Saboes, or frog
eaters, and they would just as soon destroy a person as
look at him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, they will never hurt us,” the General said, “for
we shall leave them alone and, besides, they live a great
distance from the shoe house.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you’d better watch out for them; there are a
great many of these wild men and you can never tell
when they might come along,” said the bird, who was a
mourning dove and always looked on the dark side of
things.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Teenie Weenies didn’t worry about the wild men
much, for they lived so far away and, besides, there was
the Teenie Weenie army ever ready to protect them
against an enemy. But the little people soon had cause
for worry, for a dreadful thing happened.</p>

<p class='c004'>One afternoon a snail raced slowly up to the shoe
house with alarming news—the Lady of Fashion and the
Poet had been captured by the wild men!</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gracious!” gasped the General. “How did you find
this out?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I-I-I-I saw them captured,” answered the snail. “The
wild men took them and put them in their boat and paddled
down the creek. There must have been five or six of
the wild men. They all had bows and arrows and spears
too, and they looked terribly fierce.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ring the bell,” cried the General. “We’ll have a great
council and see what can be done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Several of the Teenie Weenies ran to the old derby hat
which served the little people as a school house and armory,
and began furiously to ring the tiny bell. All the
birds and animals who lived near the little village knew
that when the bell rang long and loud it was a signal for
them to come. In a few minutes, two birds flew under the
rose bush where the village stood and one by one, several
mice, a squirrel and a couple of intelligent-looking
bugs appeared.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Friends,” said the General, addressing the assembled
crowd, “I have terrible news! The Lady of Fashion and
the Poet have been captured by the wild men. This—this
snail here has just brought the report.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Teenie Weenies and their friends were much
shocked by the news, while the snail strutted about, feeling
quite important at being the bearer of such an exciting
message.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i011.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>“When did this happen?” asked the mouse with a
squeaky voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“About five or six hours ago,” answered the snail. “I
was walkin’ near the creek when—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Five or six hours ago!” shouted the General, turning
on the snail. “For the land’s sake, why didn’t you
come immediately?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I-I-I did,” answered the snail, with an injured expression.
“I came just as fast as I could crawl.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course you did,” said the General kindly. “I beg
your pardon. I forgot for the moment that you do not
move as fast as most of us.” The snail, who had rather a
sensitive nature, was quite hurt by the General’s words
and it instantly shrank back into its shell.</p>

<p class='c004'>After some talk it was decided to scatter up and down
the creek in search of the lost Teenie Weenies. The birds
flew up and down the creek until it was quite too dark for
them to see, while the little people and the rest of their
friends hunted all through the night without a sign of the
Lady of Fashion and the Poet.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c007'>Chapter Two<br /> <br />THE CAPTURED TEENIE WEENIES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>While the Teenie Weenies were searching along
the creek for the Lady of Fashion and the Poet,
those two little people were being rapidly paddled down
the stream and away from their friends.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Lady of Fashion and the Poet had gone to the
bank of the creek for a picnic. They had eaten their
lunch and the Lady of Fashion suggested that they walk
down the stream in search of wild flowers. They had only
gone a little ways when the wild men, who had been
watching them, suddenly leaped upon them from behind
a big bush. In a few seconds the wild little fellows had
carried their tiny prisoners to their canoe, after having
securely bound their hands behind them. Lifting the Teenie
Weenies into the boat the wild men jumped in after
them and began to paddle down the creek.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is a pretty bag of seeds,” moaned the Poet as the
boat shot rapidly down the stream. “It’s hard to tell
what will become of us now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If—if we could just get word to the General,” whispered
the Lady of Fashion, “he’d bring the army and
come after these—these wild men and rescue us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s no chance of writing a note and dropping it
somewhere, with our hands tied behind us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll tell you what we can do,” whispered the Lady of
Fashion. “If we should see a bird we can call to it and
ask it to tell the General that we have been captured.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i014.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>But the two Teenie Weenies never came close enough
to a bird all that day, for the wild men paddled their canoe
near the shore of the creek under the cover of the
overhanging ferns and grass.</p>

<p><span class='color_blue'><span class='sc'>The Queen of the Wild Men, sitting on the back of her turtle.</span>—<i>Chapter Five.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>As the canoe floated along down the stream the Lady
of Fashion and the Poet spent their time studying the
strange little wild men, or Saboes, as they were called.
They were sturdily built little chaps, but a trifle smaller
than the Teenie Weenies. They had dark brown skins,
bushy hair, and around their fierce-looking eyes were
painted circles of white. One or two of the wild men wore
shirts with skirts almost to their knees, but the most of
them were dressed only in trousers which were made
from the skins of young frogs. Their spears were made
of long sticks with a sharp fish bone tied to the end, and
several of them carried bows and arrows, while their war
clubs were made by fastening sharp blackberry thorns to
a short handle. Many of the little wild men wore strings
of beautifully carved raspberry beads about their necks
and arms, which the little fellows called “gum gum,” the
Sabo name for money.</p>

<p class='c004'>The canoe, which the little men paddled very skillfully,
was made from a huge cucumber, and on the end of
the boat was painted a queer face. This face was supposed
to look like a cat and was meant to frighten the
Saboes’ enemies.</p>

<p class='c004'>When evening came on and it began to grow dark, the
wild men stopped on a sandy beach, where they made
the two Teenie Weenies understand by motions that they
would rest a while.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several of the Saboes bent over the stem of a tall dandelion,
while one of the little men gathered an armful of
the soft, fluffy down, which he put on the ground and
covered with dry grass and sticks. He then took two
sticks and rubbed them together so hard that they grew
very hot and soon a spark fell into the dandelion down,
which blazed up and quickly set fire to the grass and
sticks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently two of the wild men, who had disappeared
in the direction of the creek, returned and one of them
carried the leg of a frog over his shoulder. The little men
cut the leg into great chunks almost as big as a pea and
these were soon roasting over the fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Lady of Fashion and the Poet sat on a log beside
the fire and although the Lady of Fashion tried hard
to keep from crying, every now and then a tear would
trickle down her tiny cheek.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t worry,” said the Poet. “The General will find
some way to come to our rescue. He won’t let any harm
come to us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I-I-I s-s-s-suppose so,” sobbed the little lady. “But
I-I-I haven’t a clean handkerchief and—and—and my
hair is a sight!”</p>

<p class='c004'>In spite of the fact that the Teenie Weenies were terribly
worried, the roasting meat smelled wonderfully
good and when it was done the prisoners’ hands were
untied and they were each given a piece. Both ate a good
portion and agreed that it was delicious. They wiped
their fingers on a leaf and then the wild men tied
their hands again and made them understand that they
were to sleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>All night long the wild men kept up a bright fire. They
took turns sleeping and watching their prisoners, but the
two Teenie Weenies needed very little watching, for they
were quite tired out with the day’s experience and slept
most of the night.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the very first break of day the wild men were
awake and after a hurried breakfast of frog ham and a
blackberry which one of the men found, they once more
pushed out in the canoe and paddled down the stream.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two days later they landed on the island where the
wild men lived. When the two Teenie Weenies stepped
out of the canoe a great number of the wild little people
came running toward them. The women and children
stared at them in great astonishment, while the men
danced and swung their clubs and spears in a most terrible
way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c007'>Chapter Three<br /> <br />CAMPAIGN PREPARATIONS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>All night long the Teenie Weenies searched without
success for the captured Lady of Fashion and the
Poet. The Indian found the spot where they had been surprised
and taken. Their tiny footprints and the tracks
of the wild men, as well as the spot where the canoe had
been pushed into the water, showed plainly in the moist
sand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Him wild man, him get good start,” grunted the Indian
after he had studied the footprints for some time.
“We no catch ’um before him get home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m afraid not,” answered the General. “If that slow-poke
snail had been a little faster we might have caught
them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ugh!” was all the Indian said.</p>

<p class='c004'>When all the Teenie Weenies had returned to the little
village after the search, the General called a meeting.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Men,” he began, “we have got to do something and
do it quickly!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Call out the army, why don’t you?” shouted an excited
mouse that had joined the crowd.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe we’ll have to,” answered the General. “I
hate to use the army, but I don’t see what else we can
do. These wild men are very savage and I have been told
that there are many of them. If we go after the Lady of
Fashion and the Poet, we are going on a hard and dangerous
mission. We will have many long miles to march
and there—there may be fighting. Now, men, I will put
it to a vote. All those in favor of sending the army after
the wild men in order to free our friends will say ‘yes.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes!” shouted every single Teenie Weenie, so loudly
that they made the leaves tremble on the old rose bush
overhead.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>The little people started at once to prepare for the trip
into the forest, for it was there that the wild men lived. It
takes a great deal of work to outfit an army and the little
men were soon buzzing about as busy as bees.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two squirrels offered their services, but the General
was forced to refuse them, for they were such big eaters
that the army could not afford to feed them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several mice were hired to pull the wagons and the
cannons and also for the officers to ride.</p>

<p class='c004'>A great quantity of food and tools had to be brought
out and loaded into the wagons. It took seven hundred
grains of wheat, six hundred grains of corn, thirty raisins,
six dried prunes, fifty-eight beans, to say nothing of
cocoa, salt, pepper, baking powder, picks, shovels, pulleys,
ropes, tents, a great quantity of cheese for the mice-horses
and many other things.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was quite late that night before the wagons were
loaded and most of the little soldiers slept in their uniforms,
for the army was to start into the forest soon after
daylight.</p>

<p class='c004'>The army was to be made up of a division of ten infantrymen,
two artillerymen, two mounted scouts, two
cooks, a doctor and two nurses.</p>

<p class='c004'>The General was in command, with the Old Soldier
as chief of staff, while Paddy Pinn had command of the
artillery.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the little soldiers had said their last good-byes,
the men stepped into line and at the gruff command of the
General they swung away towards the great forest in
which the wild men lived. The Indian and the Cowboy,
mounted on mice, rode ahead of the army and picked out
the best and easiest road for the soldiers, while the Turk,
who was chosen as the aviator, flew above the army on
the back of a bird, ever watchful for enemies.</p>

<p class='c004'>At noon the army halted for lunch beneath the shade
of a lilac bush, where each man eagerly devoured the
grain of baked wheat which had been given to each soldier
that morning as his ration.</p>

<p class='c004'>After they had rested a bit, and when they had filled
their tiny canteens with water from an old tin can, the
command was given to “fall in.” Once more the army
took up the march.</p>

<p class='c004'>The army had a hard time that afternoon, for the road
it traveled was very rough. The little soldiers had to stop
every now and then to chop weeds and dandelions from
the road so the wagons and cannon could pass. Late in
the afternoon the Turk told the General he had sighted
an excellent place for a camp, and all the tired little chaps
were made very happy when the order was given to make
camp for the night.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c007'>Chapter Four<br /> <br />A WARNING IN CAMP</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>The first day’s march was very hard on the soldiers,
for the sun was hot and the little fellows were not
used to such long tramps. When the order came for the
army to break ranks and make camp ready for the night,
the soldiers worked with a will unloading the wagons
and putting up the tents. The kitchen tent was put
up first so the Cook and the Chinaman would lose
no time in getting dinner ready for the hungry army.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mice that pulled the army wagons were given a
good feed of cheese and they were quartered in a hollow
tree for the night. The airplane ate ten grains of bird
seed and hopped onto the limb of the bush under which
the tiny camp lay.</p>
<div  class='figleft id008'>
<img src='images/i024.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c004'>When the camp had been put in order for the night,
mess call was sounded and the soldiers formed in line with
their tin plates. The Cook had prepared
two boiled beans and a thimbleful of
corn soup for the army. Each man was
given a plate of soup, a big spoonful of
bean and a large piece of bread.</p>

<p class='c004'>After dinner the little soldiers gathered
on the bank of a puddle of water,
where they bathed their aching feet,
while others took off their uniforms and enjoyed a
good swim. The foolish Dunce dived head first into the
pool without first testing the water to see how deep it
was and he nearly broke his silly neck, for the hole was
only three Teenie Weenie feet (a little over an inch and a
half) deep.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Believe me!” exclaimed the Dunce after he was pulled
out of the water and sat on the bank rubbing a big bump
on his head, “I’m through diving. I wouldn’t dive into a
teacup full of water even if I could see the bottom.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The General decided to let the army rest for a day, as
the soldiers all complained of sore feet and, besides, one
of the horses was bothered with a lame leg, which had
been hurt in a mouse trap a few days before. The men
were given a little light rifle practice, while Paddy Pinn
tried out the cannon at long range shooting, bringing
down a dandelion in three shots at the remarkable range
of four hundred and twenty Teenie Weenie feet (17 feet
in our measurement).</p>

<p class='c004'>The noise of the cannon attracted the attention of
many birds, squirrels, bugs and field mice, who gathered
around the edge of the camp with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the trouble?” asked a bright-eyed chipmunk.
“Is there a war or somethin’?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” answered the General kindly. “We are on our
way to rescue a couple of Teenie Weenies who have been
stolen by the wild men who live in the heart of the big
woods.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you’d better go back,” warned the Chipmunk.
“Those wild men are a bad lot and they are as thick as
bees in clover time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We are not afraid,” answered the General. “We will
keep on until we have rescued our friends.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i026.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>“All right! All right!” said the Chipmunk solemnly.
“I wouldn’t give a wormy chestnut for your lives, but
that’s your choosing, not mine. Let me tell you one thing—don’t
forget that I warned you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you just the same for your advice,” said the
General, “but we must go on.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right!” muttered the Chipmunk. “But remember
I warned you.” And shaking his head wisely he scampered
off into the thick weeds.</p>

<p class='c004'>The little soldiers rolled themselves up in their tiny
blankets almost immediately after supper and almost before
the sun had disappeared over the western hills they
were sound asleep, for they were to be up and well on the
march before daylight again would appear.</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c007'>Chapter Five<br /> <br />THE QUEEN OF THE WILD MEN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>Although the wild men who had captured the
Lady of Fashion and the Poet were good to them,
the two Teenie Weenies nevertheless were much alarmed
as to what might happen, for the wild men kept their captives’
hands securely tied, and they watched them closely
at all times.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the wild men brought the two Teenie Weenies
to the island where the savages lived, the captives were
the center of much interest.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Sabo men and women came swarming down to
the water’s edge from all directions. They shouted and
jabbered in a language the Lady of Fashion and the Poet
had never before heard. Some came gliding out of the
tall grass, while others peered from behind bushes and
pebbles, quite as though they were a little afraid of the
two helpless Teenie Weenies.</p>

<div  class='figleft id009'>
<img src='images/i028.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>The women were curious
little people. They
were dressed in short
dresses which came down
to their knees and the
cloth was woven out of
thistledown and was
wonderfully soft. The women dressed their hair in a
strange manner. The Lady of Fashion could hardly
keep from laughing at them, for it was coiled up to a
point high in the air, shaped much like an ice cream cone.
Most of the men were dressed in frogskin trousers, while
the children wore bits of cloth about their waists.</p>

<p class='c004'>The men and women gathered around and carefully
examined the clothes of the two Teenie Weenies, especially
the Poet’s glasses, which were considered very wonderful
by the wild little people.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a time the Lady of Fashion and the Poet were
led along a path toward the center of the island, followed
by a great crowd of Saboes. Presently one of the wild men
who was walking ahead suddenly dropped to his knees
and kissed the ground. Looking up, the two Teenie
Weenies saw a very big turtle with a very short, fat
woman sitting on its back. A man who walked beside
the turtle with a hook in his hand, gave the turtle a sharp
blow on the nose and the big fellow pulled his head into
his shell and stopped.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well!” exclaimed the Lady of Fashion. “I wonder
who this fine lady can be.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, why, this must be a sort of queen,” answered
the Poet. “Maybe she is the queen of the wild men.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Poet had guessed correctly. The fat lady on the
turtle was no other than Her Royal Highness, Queen
Mooie, ruler of the wild men.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c007'>Chapter Six<br /> <br />THE STORM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>Before the sun had time to peep over the eastern
hills the third morning, the little army was on the
march. All day the soldiers tramped along, stopping
every now and then to rest a few minutes beneath the
shade of a friendly dandelion or burdock. All along the
line of march many bugs, ants and birds gathered by the
roadside to cheer the brave little army as it trudged by.</p>

<p class='c004'>“General,” said the Turk, as he slid off the back of the
airplane, “it looks to me as though we were going to have
a storm and I would suggest that you lose no time in finding
a dry place to house the army.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” answered the General, “I’ll order the Indian
to ride ahead and select a place to camp.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Even as the General spoke, the little soldiers heard the
distant rumble of thunder, and the Indian, putting spurs
to his mouse, quickly bounded away in search of a camp.
Presently he returned with the good news that he had
found a fine place to weather the storm.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i031.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>A hollow log had been selected for the camp and the
little men soon pulled the cannon and army wagons into
the dark hole. In a short time the storm broke with great
fury and it was a mighty good thing that the little army
was protected by the hollow log, for the burdock leaves
under which the Teenie Weenies always sought shelter
from the rain would have been a poor place in such a big
storm. The poor mice who pulled the army wagons trembled
in terror at the loud peals of thunder. The Dunce
shook so much with fright he almost loosened the buttons
of his uniform.</p>

<p class='c004'>The storm passed quickly and the General ordered
the army to be on its way, but the marching was hard and
the men made slow progress, for the ground was muddy.
The army marched around most of the mud holes, but one
was too long and they were forced to wade through the
thick mud. Most of the soldiers got over safely, but one
of the wagons stuck in the mud and to make things
worse, one of the back wheels was broken in trying to
pull it out.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is a pretty pickle!” growled the Old Soldier,
sliding off his mouse at the edge of the puddle. “We’ll
have to work fast to get this wagon out before dark.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We might just as well unload the wagon, for we will
never be able to pull it out while it’s loaded,” said the
General.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the mud was quite deep, several of the soldiers
were ordered to put on bathing suits and carry the baggage
to solid ground. After much hard work the wagon
was finally pulled out of the mud, although it took half
the army and six of the mice to do it. As it was quite late
in the afternoon, the army went into camp, while the Turk
and the Old Soldier set to work to mend the broken
wheel.</p>

  <h2 id='ch07' class='c007'>Chapter Seven<br /> <br />A SUSPENSION BRIDGE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>The General fumed and fussed over the delay caused
by the broken wheel.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s just one thing after another,” he grumbled. “If
it isn’t one thing it’s something else.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, General, it won’t do a bit of good to worry,”
said Tess Bone, one of the Red Cross Nurses. “We’ll have
to do the best we can and that’s all anybody can do—even
a Teenie Weenie can’t do more.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course, of course,” answered the General, as he
paced up and down before his tiny tent. “I know it
doesn’t do a bit of good to worry, but we must hurry if we
ever expect to rescue the Lady of Fashion and the Poet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The anxious General had the army up before daylight
the next morning. They ate a hurried breakfast and were
well on the way before the sun came up. In fact, the
Dunce marched nearly an hour before he was fully
awake.</p>

<p class='c004'>The big rain of the day before had left many puddles
along the way and the little army often had to splash
through them.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the help of the scouts, the army was able to find
the best roads, for the Indian and the Cowboy, mounted
on mice, rode ahead and picked out the best path. The
Turk was of much help, too, in picking out the best roads,
for he was able to see a great distance from the back of
his bird airplane.</p>

<p class='c004'>“General,” said the Cowboy one afternoon as he rode
up to the commander of the little army, “I believe there’s
more trouble ahead of us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” shouted the General. “Great guns, now
what’s the trouble?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, sir, there’s a stream of water and I’m afraid
we’ll be forced to march a long way out of our road before
we can find a place shallow enough to cross. I talked to
a field mouse who seemed to be familiar with the country,
and he said there was no place where the stream
could be crossed for many miles in each direction.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope, sir, you were careful not to say where you
were going,” said the General. “We are now nearing the
land of our enemies and we are liable to meet with a spy
at almost any time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was mighty careful, sir, and told him nothing that
might be used against us,” answered the Cowboy.</p>

<p class='c004'>The General ordered the Turk to fly up and down the
stream on a scouting trip while the army stopped for
lunch. Late in the afternoon the Turk reported to the
General that they would have to take a two days’ march
out of their road to a place where the stream could be
crossed. The army pushed on and shortly after dark
stopped near the stream, where camp was made for the
night.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next morning the Doctor, the Old Soldier, Paddy
Pinn and the General gathered on the banks of the raging
stream to see what plan could be made for crossing the
water.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i037.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>The banks were very steep and the water was quite
too swift to ford, although the stream was only two feet
wide (in our measurement). It was finally determined
that there was nothing to do but build a bridge.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We can throw a sort of suspension bridge across the
stream,” said the Old Soldier, who was quite an engineer.
“It will take us about a day and a half to do the work,
but we will save time, for it would take fully two or three
days to march to a place where we could cross without a
bridge.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The war council thought the Old Soldier’s idea a good
one and the General ordered the men to start work at
once. Pulleys and ropes were brought out of the army
wagons and some big logs for supports were cut from a
bush near by. Several cattails, which grew near the
stream, were sawed up into logs for the floor of the bridge.
The bird airplane carried the workmen and ropes to the
other side of the stream, where work was soon started on
a bridge fifty-two Teenie Weenie feet long.</p>

</div>
<p class='c002'>It took a lot of hard work to build the big bridge. Every
single Teenie Weenie worked with might and main.
Even the mice who pulled the wagons and cannon,
helped the work along by dragging the heavy logs up to
the place where the bridge was being built.</p>

<p class='c004'>The little army was a full day and a half building the
bridge and when the task was finished the wagons were
loaded, the mice hitched to them, and led by the General,
the army marched safely across the bridge.</p>

<p class='c004'>A big squirrel who lived in a tree near by was hired to
watch the bridge.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We may want to get across this stream in a hurry,”
the General told the squirrel. “If the wild men should push
us back to this stream, and the bridge is destroyed, we
certainly will be in a pretty pickle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll guard it with my life,” answered the squirrel, who
had been promised ten sunflower seeds and four hickory
nuts for his work.</p>

<p class='c004'>The army once more took up the march and presently
they drew nearer and nearer the forest. Great bushes
overhung the path along which the soldiers marched.
Tall, bright-colored toadstools grew by the wayside and
everything was dark and mysterious.</p>

<p class='c004'>At noon the army was halted for lunch. The little soldiers
sat on the soft moss under a big fern and each man
ate the grain of boiled rice and bit of dried raisin which
he had tucked into his tiny haversack that morning.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i040.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>When the men had eaten, the General ordered them
to fall into line and stepping in front of them he said:
“Men, I have been informed by our aviator and by our
scouts that we are rapidly drawing near the land of the
wild men, so from now on straggling will not be permitted.
Soldiers wandering away from the army run the
chance of being captured and we will soon have need of
all our brave men.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The General’s talk impressed the little soldiers, and
the Dunce and Gogo, who often wandered away from the
line of march, were very much “on the job” all afternoon.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the army marched beneath a bush, late in the day,
it suddenly came face to face with a small garter snake
that lay near a big stone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“O-O-O-O-O-oh, j-j-j-imminie C-c-c-c-christmas!”
screamed the Dunce.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mouse on which the General rode gave one frightened
look at the snake and quickly ran up the bush,
dumping the dignified General off on his Teenie Weenie
head. The rest of the army fled in all directions, in spite
of the Old Soldier, who tried with all his might to stop the
frightened soldiers. The snake was almost as badly
scared as the army and it wriggled into a hole near by
with remarkable speed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, this is a fine army, I must say!” growled the
General when the Old Soldier had finally got the soldiers
back in line. “If you men run at the sight of a little snake,
what will you do when you face real wild men?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pardon me, sir,” said Gogo, saluting the General.
“We-all don’t mind fightin’ the wild men, but—we-all
done object to bein’ et.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Forward, march!” shouted the General, and the little
army moved on towards the wild men’s land.</p>

  <h2 id='ch09' class='c007'>Chapter Nine<br /> <br />THE CAPTIVES ATTEND A DANCE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>While the Teenie Weenie soldiers were gallantly
marching to the rescue of their little friends, the
Lady of Fashion and the Poet were being kept prisoners
in one of the funny little houses of the wild men.</p>

<p class='c004'>Queen Mooie, ruler of the Saboes, was a very fat little
lady, and like all fat people, big or little, she was very
good-natured. When the Lady of Fashion and the Poet
were brought before her, she was much interested in them
and she made a long speech to the two Teenie Weenies in
her strange language, but not one word could the little
people understand.</p>

<p class='c004'>The house in which the Lady of Fashion and the Poet
were kept was built up on posts about six Teenie Weenie
feet (three inches in our measurement) from the ground.
The houses were built up high as protection from the
dampness, for the Saboes lived on a little island in the
heart of a big swamp, and it also protected the little people
from bugs. The floor of the house was made of sticks
and the roof and sides were covered with a peculiar
swamp grass. A flat stone about the size of a half dollar
was placed on the floor, on which the wild men built a tiny
fire to keep themselves warm in winter, and a small hole in
the roof provided a chimney for the smoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>Twice a day the wild men brought the two Teenie
Weenies delicious pieces of smoked frog ham, with many
tiny rice cakes, and every other day the two prisoners
were given a blackberry.</p>

<p class='c004'>One night shortly after the Lady of Fashion and the
Poet had been brought to the wild men’s village, the two
Teenie Weenies heard the beating of a drum. For what
seemed hours the little prisoners listened to the tumtum,
tumtum, tumtum, of the drum. There was no use asking
the wild man who guarded them just outside their door,
for he couldn’t understand them, so there was nothing to
do but listen to the tumtum, tumtum, tumtum, and wonder
what it was all about.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i043.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>Presently one of the wild men
climbed up the ladder to their house
and motioned the two Teenie Weenies
to follow him. He led them beneath a
bush near by, where a lot
of wild men were dancing
about a great fire. The
men sang a queer sort of
song as they danced, while one strange-looking fellow,
who was a sort of witch doctor, rattled a huge seed pod
fastened to the end of a forked stick. The wild men performed
this strange dance once a month, as they believed
it would keep bad luck away from their tribe.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Queen of the wild men sat near the fire on the
back of her turtle, while the rest of the Saboes stood in a
circle about the dancing men. The fire had been built in
a deep hole on top of a large stone and when the stone
was almost red-hot, the wild men scraped the fire all out
with long sticks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then they lined the hole in the stone with sassafras
leaves, into which they threw four large frog hams and
then covered them over with several big leaves. Sand
was then thrown onto the leaves, covering the hams
tightly in the hot hole.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wild men built a fire all around the outside edge
of the stone, and while the hams cooked they again took
up the wild dance. When the hams were baked they
were taken out and a piece was served to each person
and the Lady of Fashion and the Poet both enjoyed the
delicious meat.</p>

<p class='c004'>After everyone had eaten of the ham, the Queen
ordered the two Teenie Weenies to be taken back to their
prison, but although it was very late, the Lady of Fashion
and the Poet could hear the loud shouts of the wild little
people for many hours.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c007'>Chapter Ten<br /> <br />HELP FROM A GROUND ROBIN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>The army was now in the very heart of the great
forest and it took a lot of hard work to get the heavy
wagons and cannon through the jungle. At times a path
had to be chopped through the tall grass and all this
had to be done as silently as possible, for the army was
now likely to run across the wild men at any time.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t want these wild men to know that we are in
the neighborhood,” the General warned the troops. “It
is much better to surprise them, and, besides, there is no
telling just what they may do to the Lady of Fashion
and the Poet if they discover that we have come to
rescue them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The path the army now followed was so rough that
little headway could be made and the General had to
order a halt every now and then to rest the mice and
men. During one of these stops the General fell into conversation
with a pert-looking little ground robin who had
hopped onto the limb of a bush near by.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you know just where these wild men live?”
asked the General.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll say I does,” answered the robin, who used very
bad grammar. “I knows more about ’em than I wants
to. The nasty little scalawags! These wild men get most
all the seeds hereabouts and it’s all an honest bird can
do to scratch out a bare living.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Could you guide us for a few days?” put in the
General.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i046.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Gracious!” tittered the bird, “you’d never reach the
wild men’s place in a few days with all those wagons
and mice. They live on an island. You’ll have to have a
boat or somethin’ to carry you over the water.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have heard that they live on an island,” said the
General, “but I mean could you show us the way to the
water where we would be nearest to the island?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course I could,” answered the bird; “that is, providin’
it would be worth my time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We will pay you,” said the General. “We’ll give you
six sunflower seeds for your work.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Make it six and a half seeds and I’ll do it,” cried
the bird.</p>

<p class='c004'>The General agreed and the bird hopped along ahead
of the army, jumping onto a bush occasionally to point
out the best path. After a couple of hours’ march, the
army came out onto a sandy beach, where the General
called a halt.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is the place and over there is the island,” cried
the bird, nodding his head towards the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Teenie Weenies looked across the water and they
could see the dim outlines of the island.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ground robin was paid his six and a half sunflower
seeds and in a short time the tired little soldiers put up the
tiny tents and made a most cozy little camp. They named
it camp Bitem, because of the many mosquitoes about the
place.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the General did not wish a fire to be built for fear
the wild men might see the light, the little army made its
dinner on two sliced strawberries and a few grains of rice.
No lights were lit that night in the camp and a strong
guard watched carefully throughout the silent hours,
which were disturbed only by the sentinels as they killed
mosquitoes with the butts of their rifles or stabbed them
with their bayonets.</p>

<p class='c004'>Early the next morning the men set to work building
a raft which was to be used in carrying the army across
the water to the wild men’s island.</p>

<p class='c004'>A great many logs had to be cut, trimmed and brought
to the water’s edge. The Cowboy hitched one of the
strongest mice to the heavy logs and one by one they
were hauled up to the workmen, who labored for nearly
three days before the raft was done.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i048.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>While the men were at work on the raft, the Turk flew
over the wild men’s island in search of a good place for
the army to land and at the same time he kept an eye
open for the Lady of Fashion and the Poet. He flew as
near as he could to the wild men’s village without being
seen, but he could see no signs of the two Teenie Weenies.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think the wild men have the Lady of Fashion and
the Poet locked up in one of their houses,” the Turk told
the General when he slid off the bird’s back at the army
camp. “I noticed one of the houses was closely guarded
and I think we shall find them there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll soon find out,” answered the General, “for the
army will be on the wild men’s island in a mighty short
time.” Taking the Turk by the arm, the General showed
him where the raft was being built.</p>

</div>
<p class='c002'>While the Lady of Fashion and the Poet were being
held prisoner by the Saboes, the Poet very carefully
listened to the wild men’s strange language and in
a short time he was able to speak a few of their words.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jinks, but it is hot in this shanty!” he said to the
Lady of Fashion one morning as he wiped his forehead
with his Teenie Weenie handkerchief and looked out
through the tiny hole that served as a window in the
house in which they were held prisoners.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If the Queen would just let us go out and take a little
exercise once in a while it would help a lot,” suggested
the Lady of Fashion fanning herself with a dry leaf.
“Why don’t you ask the Queen? Maybe she will let us
take a walk now and then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll do it,” answered the Poet, and looking out
through the door he called to one of the wild men who
stood near guarding the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gip bah wah hoo,” said the Poet, which means in
Sabo, “We need exercise.” “Tell the Queen we want to
get out of this shanty and take a walk once in a while,”
he continued in the wild men’s language.</p>

<p><span class='color_blue'><span class='sc'>The Wild Men attack the Teenie Weenies, as their raft nears the island.</span>—<i>Chapter Thirteen.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The wild man grunted a couple of times and hurried
off through the long grass towards the Queen’s house,
while the two Teenie Weenies sat down near the tiny door
to await his return.</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently the wild man came back and told the Poet
that the Queen said that the Teenie Weenies could take
a walk whenever they liked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we’ll take a walk right this minute,” announced
the Poet, and he quickly helped the Lady of Fashion
down the tiny ladder.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Teenie Weenies strolled along through the
streets of the village while the two guards walked a few
feet behind them. A great many children followed the
Teenie Weenies about but, although the Lady of Fashion
tried to make friends with them, they were very timid
and stood off at a safe distance.</p>

<p class='c004'>At one place two wild women were preparing dinner
and the Teenie Weenies were much interested in what
they saw. One woman was baking rice cakes on a flat
stone under which a fire was burning, while a young girl
was grinding wild rice into flour by pounding the rice
with a small rock in a hollowed-out stone. Near the house
was a hollowed-out log with leaves spread over the top
to keep out the dust, and one of the guards told the Poet
that the log was filled with salt water in which the frog
hams were pickled before they were smoked.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i054.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>The two Teenie Weenies spent a very pleasant afternoon
looking about the village and it was quite late before
they returned to their prison.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, dear me,” said the Lady of Fashion as she threw
herself down on one of the soft grass mats, “I wonder
what is going to happen to us. Do you think the General
will come with the army and rescue us?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course he will,” answered the Poet. “All we have
to do is to be patient and he’ll be here pretty soon.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what if he doesn’t know that we have been captured
by these wild men?” asked the Lady of Fashion
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He will know all right,” said the Poet. “The Teenie
Weenies could see the footprints of the wild men in the
sand where we were captured. That is enough to tell
them what has happened to us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, dear, if they would only come!” And the poor
little lady began to sob.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here! Here!” said the Poet anxiously, for he always
felt mighty uncomfortable whenever the Lady of Fashion
cried. “You must not cry. That won’t do a bit of good—just
makes you feel bad and me worse.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I-I-I c-c-can’t help it,” sobbed the little lady. “I want
clean clothes, my hair needs washing, I want some of the
Cook’s good apple butter, I want my toothbrush and I-I-I
want to go home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Poet tried his best to comfort her and presently
she cried herself to sleep.</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c007'>Chapter Twelve<br /> <br />GOGO’S BRAVE ACT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>After much sawing, chopping and splitting of logs,
the Teenie Weenies finally finished building the raft
which was to carry the little army to the wild men’s
island.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ve got to give the raft a trial before we get all
loaded up with supplies,” said the Old Soldier when the
work had been done. “I’ll take it on the water this afternoon
and give it a good try-out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quite right, quite right,” agreed the General as he
sat down on a dry fern leaf. “We’ll have to send the army
over in two trips. First the infantry can be taken over,
then the raft can return for the artillery and some supplies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will the raft carry the cannon and the two mice that
pull it?” asked the Doctor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly,” said the Old Soldier. “It even ought to
hold a good-sized paving brick.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you can just bet I won’t get on that old raft until
it has been thoroughly tried out,” announced Tess
Bone as she arranged her dainty little cap and patted the
Red Cross badge on her arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s the way I feel about it too,” added Sally Guff,
the other nurse with the army.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t need to worry about this raft,” laughed
the Old Soldier. “It’s well made and every log is securely
tied with strong, number forty thread.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i057.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>Right after lunch the General ordered several of the
soldiers to help the Old Soldier take the raft out for a trial
trip.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the help of the big sweep on the stern of the raft
and the use of several long poles, the little men slowly
pushed the craft out into the stream.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jumping beans!” exclaimed the Old Soldier as the
raft slid easily out into the water. “That is what I call a
good—” but the Old Soldier never finished the sentence,
for at that very moment a big frog poked his head out of
the water and hopped up onto the raft.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oooooo, a-a-a s-s-submarine!” gasped the Dunce.
“Jump for your lives,” and he leaped head first into the
deep water.</p>

<p class='c004'>Most of the Teenie Weenies gave one look at the ugly
frog, followed the Dunce into the water and swam as
fast as they could for shore. The Old Soldier and Gogo
were the only men to hold their ground, and if it had
not been for these brave little fellows, the frog would
have captured the transport without a battle. The Old
Soldier drew his sword and attacked the frog, while Gogo
struck the big fellow over the head with the boat pole.
The frog, who had been attracted by the red coats of the
soldiers, had hopped onto the raft in search of a meal,
but he quickly slid back into the water at the first blow
of the boat pole.</p>

<p class='c004'>The soldiers who had jumped into the water were
much ashamed of their behavior and they all quickly
returned to the raft and finished the trial trip they had
started.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My brave lad,” said the General, grasping Gogo by
the hand when the raft returned from its trip, “in behalf
of the Teenie Weenie army I want to thank you for your
great bravery and I hereby promote you to first sergeant
in the Teenie Weenie army.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, dat’s all right, General,” said Gogo, much confused
at the honor thrust upon him. “There’s no fool
frog what’s done gonna scare me when I’s mad, and I was
certainly mad at that fool frog.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The raft proved to be thoroughly seaworthy, so the
General gave orders for the men to be ready to board
her just as soon as the wind and current were favorable
for the trip to the wild men’s island.</p>

</div>
<p class='c002'>It was a long trip to the wild men’s island and the
General wished to make the journey under cover of
darkness. “I want to land on the island before daybreak
so we can surprise the wild men,” the General told his
officers, who were gathered for a council of war.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Sailor tells me,” continued the General, “that
the wind and current are just right to sail the raft over
to-night. I will take over the infantry on the first trip
and then the raft can return for the artillery and the baggage
and the rear guard, which the Old Soldier will command.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Cook had a great pot of rice cooked and he had
stewed five lima beans. This great amount of food was
portioned out, and three days’ rations were given to each
soldier.</p>

<p class='c004'>A number of picks and shovels, with a lot of bags and
a chest of bullets, was loaded onto the raft.</p>

<p class='c004'>Promptly at eleven o’clock the General, followed by
several men, marched onto the raft and some of the soldiers
with long poles quickly pushed out into the dark
stream.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The Sailor and the Cowboy handled the big sweep at
the back of the raft, while the Policeman and the Scotchman
pushed wherever they could with the long poles.</p>

<p class='c004'>No lights were allowed on the raft and the men were
ordered to talk only in whispers, for the General wished
to land on the island unknown to the wild men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“J-j-j-jimminie C-c-christmas!” stuttered the trembling
Dunce, “I-I-I’m not a-a bit s-s-scared. Are you,
G-g-gogo?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not v-v-very m-m-much,” answered the colored lad,
trying to keep his knees from knocking together. “I
done hope we-all—”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i063.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>But at that minute, the raft struck something with such
a bang it nearly upset most of the little soldiers. In fact,
the Scotchman would have tumbled into the water if the
Cowboy hadn’t caught him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The raft had struck the limb of an old tree that lay in
the water and to the alarm of the General it stuck fast.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is terrible. Perfectly terrible,” groaned the General,
glancing towards the eastern sky. “It will soon be
daylight and the wild men will see us if we are delayed
here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The men worked with might and main to free the raft,
but it was stuck tight to the snag and before they managed
to get it free it was broad daylight.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The wild men have very likely seen us by this time,”
said the General, peering towards the island. “So instead
of our surprising them, they probably will surprise
us, but we have got to land. Examine your rifles and see
that they are in condition to use, for we are likely to have
a fight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look there!” cried the Sailor, pointing towards the
shore, for the raft was now only a short distance from the
island. “There’s something behind that stick.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe it’s a wild man,” suggested the Dunce, turning
a trifle pale. “Don’t you think we had better go back,
General?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We intend to go on,” said the General, glancing
scornfully at the frightened Dunce, “but if you want to
you can jump into the water and swim back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I-I-I think I’ll stay here,” said the Dunce as he
thought of the many frogs and turtles that might snap
him up if he tried to swim back.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the raft drew near the shore, several arrows whistled
over the soldiers’ heads and instantly a number of
wild men sprang up from behind a stick that lay on the
shore and began shooting at the raft.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Make ready, men!” shouted the General, drawing his
sword. “Shoot over the wild men’s heads when I give the
word to fire. We don’t want to hurt any of them if we can
avoid it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“O-o-o-oh, I-I-I’m shot!” screamed the Dunce, as an
arrow knocked his hat from his head, but the rest of the
little soldiers never heard the foolish fellow, for they stood
ready, awaiting the General’s order to fire.</p>

<p class='c015'>THE GENERAL,</p>
<div class='c016'>Commander in Chief of the Teenie Weenie Army.</div>

<p class='c013'>P. S.—I forgot to say that none of my men was hurt in
the battle except the Dunce, who was badly scared by being
shot through the hat.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, sir,” saluted the Turk, and springing onto the
back of the airplane he quickly flew out of sight over the
water.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>

</div>

<p class='c004'>When the Old Soldier received the General’s message,
he set to work at once breaking camp and when the raft
arrived the artillery was quickly loaded. The raft made
two trips during the day and most of the necessary baggage
was taken over to the island.</p>

<p class='c004'>A line of trenches was considered necessary by the
General, who ordered Sergeant Gogo to direct the work
and that brave little chap had the trenches done in a remarkably
short time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nothing more was seen of the wild men, but the closest
watch was kept, for there was no telling when they might
appear again.</p>

<p class='c004'>The little soldiers were much too excited to sleep and
most of them sat about the tiny camp fire until a late hour
talking of the day’s experience, but one by one they finally
rolled up in their tiny blankets and slept, while the guards
paced back and forth, ever watchful for prowling wild
men.</p>

  <h2 id='ch15' class='c007'>Chapter Fifteen<br /> <br />A COUNCIL OF WAR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>For several days the army spent their time building
trenches and making a comfortable camp, while the
army scouts learned all they could about the wild men
and the lie of the land.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Red Cross tent had been set up and the tiny cots
looked very pretty, with their clean white sheets. Fortunately,
there had been little use for them, as the army had
been unusually healthy, the only exception being the
Chinaman, who had been badly bitten by a pollywog, or
tadpole, while he was taking a swim in the river.</p>

<p class='c004'>There had been very little excitement in camp for
some time. Not a single wild man had been seen since
the morning the army had landed on the raft and the soldiers
had nothing much to do while off guard duty but to
kill mosquitoes, which were thick about the camp.</p>

<p class='c004'>Early one morning the Turk was called to the General’s
tent, where he remained for some time.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Somethin’ doin’, I’ll bet,” thought the Dunce, who
was on guard duty at the time in front of headquarters.</p>

<p class='c004'>Something really was doing, for the Turk was ordered
to fly out at once and make a careful map of Sabo Island.
The Turk hurried to his tent, where he supplied himself
with paper and pencils and a pair of tiny field glasses.
The army airplane was dining on a fat worm when the
Turk arrived, so he sat down and waited until the bird had
eaten his breakfast.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ve got to go out and make a map of the wild men’s
island,” said the Turk.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” answered the bird, “I’m ready,” and hopping
onto the ground he squatted down while the Turk
climbed up on his fat back.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id012'>
<img src='images/i070.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>The Turk headed the bird to a big tree which grew on
the river bank near the island and in a few minutes the
airplane settled easily on the topmost branch. The great
blue river lay far beneath the Turk and with the help of
his field glasses he was able to make a good map of the
island and the surrounding country.</p>

<p class='c004'>When he returned to the Teenie Weenie camp the
General immediately called a council of war and the little
aviator was asked to explain the map in detail.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” began the Turk, “the circle marked Camp Bitem
is the place where we camped and built the raft and the
dotted line is the course we took to our present camp. The
wild men have a sort of camp or fort, I couldn’t just exactly
make out what it was, but anyhow they are gathered
in some force on the only cleared ground between
their village and our camp.”</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>MAP OF WILD MEN’S ISLAND.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“We couldn’t march through the grass and trees and
cut the wild men’s camp off from the village, could we?”
asked the Old Soldier.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, sir, I don’t think so,” answered the Turk, “for I
do not believe anyone could possibly get through the
grass and trees.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, that’s too bad,” muttered the General. “I
wanted to get those wild men out of that place with as little
trouble as possible, but it looks as though we would
have to take their fort by storm.”</p>

<p class='c004'>All the Teenie Weenie officers gathered in the General’s
tent listened solemnly to their commander’s words,
for they knew it would be mighty serious if they were
forced to charge the wild men’s fort.</p>

</div>
<p class='c002'>“I done got ’em bottled up! I done got ’em bottled
up!” shouted Gogo, the little colored Teenie Weenie,
as he ran panting up to the General’s tent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s bottled up? What’s all the excitement
about?” asked the General, popping his head through
the opening of his tent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why I-I-I done ketched one of the wild men and
turned him ovah to the guard and I done got three mo’
corked up in a bottle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great Guns! This is exciting. Tell me about it,” cried
the General.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you see it’s dis way,” said Gogo, sitting down
on a pebble and mopping his head with his tiny handkerchief.
“I done took a walk out beyond the picket lines yonder.
I knew I had no business wanderin’ out dere, but I
jus’ kept on and pretty soon I run across a big bottle
a-layin’ on its side.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was kind of ’spicious about dat bottle, fo’ I done see
through de glass where some dry grass had done been
fixed up fo’ a bed, mighty like some one been sleepin’
dere.</p>

<div  class='figleft id013'>
<img src='images/i074.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c004'>“‘Gogo,’ I says to myself, ‘some one been sleepin’ heah
in dis bottle and it ain’t none of de Teenie Weenies, fo’
none of dem has been out heah dis
far.’ Den I made up my mind that
it mus’ be some of dem scalawag
wild men and I reckon dey mus’
stayed in dis bottle when dey was on
guard duty watchin’ our army.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘But why did dey-all stay in
dis heah bottle?’ I says to myself.
‘It’s not cold nights.’ But jus’ den a
big mosquito cam’ a-buzzin’ and a-buzzin’ round and den
I knew dat the wild men been a-stayin’ in dat bottle fo’ to
keep de mosquitoes from bitin’ ’em.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I says to myself, ‘Some of dese wild men will be comin’
’round heah pretty soon and maybe I can done cotch ’em
and extinguish myself.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Distinguish yourself,” corrected the General.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sah,” continued the little colored fellow. “Well,
I done crawl under a leaf and waited. I done wait fo’ a
long time, but pretty soon I done see fo’ of de wild men
come sneakin’ along and pretty soon dey done make right
fo’ de bottle. Three of ’em done crawl in de bottle and
one of ’em done squat down outside by de openin’ of de
bottle kinda like he was guardin’.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘By de great corn pone,’ I says, ‘if a couple of de Teenie
Weenies was heah we could done cotch dese scalawags.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pretty soon I thought to myself, ‘Why don’t you ketch
’em yourself?’ So I done sneaked out up behind de wild
man what was guardin’ de mouth of de bottle and done
cracked him on de head with de butt of my gun. I didn’t
hit very hard—just hard enough to stun him a little—and
den I grabbed a cork dat was layin’ near by and stuffed
it into de bottle and braced it with a stick of wood so the
scalawags couldn’t get out. I then picked up de wild man
I had knocked down and brought him into camp and
dat’s all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A very brave deed, sergeant,” said the General. “And
I will immediately send out a squad of men to bring your
prisoners into camp.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Old Soldier was ordered to take a squad of men
and go after the prisoners, while the Doctor was sent to
dress the bump on the head of the wild man that Gogo
had knocked down. After a great deal of work the soldiers
managed to pull the three wild men out of the bottle
and when they were brought into camp they were securely
tied to a strong blade of grass.</p>

  <h2 id='ch17' class='c007'>Chapter Seventeen<br /> <br />THE DUNCE IN DISGRACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>“Why are you making such a fine camp here, General?”
asked the Doctor, as he noticed that the
Teenie Weenies continued to improve the camp. “Won’t
we have to move on pretty soon if the wild men do not
attack?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll stay right here for some time,” answered the
General, taking off his tiny sword and laying it on the
table which stood in front of his tent. “We are within
striking distance of the wild men’s village, so the aviator
tells me, and we’ll use this camp for our base of operations.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“General,” said the Cook, saluting the commander of
the Teenie Weenie army, “I beg your pardon, but there
is something I must tell you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it, sir?” said the General, returning the
Cook’s salute.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why sir, there’s a thimble missing from among my
cooking things. I put two beans to soak in it last night
and when I went to look at them a little while ago the
beans were lying on the ground and the thimble was
gone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s most strange,” said the General; “I’ll have the
Cowboy look into the matter and see if he can find out
what has happened to the thimble.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you, sir,” said the Cook, “I’m a little short of
cooking pans and kettles and I’d like to have it back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Cowboy was ordered to look for the lost thimble,
but before he had fairly started the search, the thimble
turned up in a most peculiar way. Down the main street
of the camp towards the General’s tent marched the
Dunce with the lost thimble over his head and followed
by a laughing crowd of soldier.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the idea of this?” asked the General as the
Dunce stopped before him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Safety first,” answered the Dunce.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean by safety first?” asked the General,
trying hard to keep from laughing at the ridiculous
sight.</p>

<p class='c004'>“W-w-well, you s-s-see,” began the Dunce, “I thought
this thimble would make a fine suit of armor, and protect
me from the wild men’s arrows. I took it out back of camp,
got some tools and cut a couple of holes for my arms to go
through and another hole to see through—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, and spoiled a perfectly good thimble,” put in
the General.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jinks!” exclaimed the Dunce, “I never thought of
that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course you didn’t,” answered the General sternly.
“You have a habit of doing your thinking afterwards,
and that is a mighty bad habit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quite right! Quite right!” cried a field mouse, who had
been hanging around the camp for a few days. “Quite
right, I says. There’s always a time to think. One ought
to do a heap of thinking before one acts, I says.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i078.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, you’re right,” put in the General, glaring at the
mouse, who was very talkative. “One ought to think a
great deal and then he ought to say only about one half of
what he thinks.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Words of wisdom! Words of wisdom!” cried the
mouse, never dreaming the General’s rebuke was aimed at
him, and he strolled down the camp street quite pleased
with himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, Dunce,” said the General, “I’m going to try to
see if I can help you do a little thinking.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Y-y-yes, s-s-s-sir,” answered the Dunce.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m going to make you wear that thimble for the rest
of the day and that ought to help you to remember that
you have spoiled a perfectly good cooking pot, just because
you didn’t happen to think.”</p>

<p class='c004'>All day long the poor Dunce was forced to walk up
and down in front of the General’s tent, wearing the
heavy thimble. It was a warm day and the thimble grew
quite hot in the sunshine, so his punishment was pretty
hard, but there is no doubt it did him a great deal of good.</p>

  <h2 id='ch18' class='c007'>Chapter Eighteen<br /> <br />CONSULTING AN ENGINEER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>The General studied the map of the wild men’s island
which the Turk had drawn, in the hope that he could
figure out a way to attack the Saboes without storming
their fort. In storming the fort, the General felt sure that
many of his soldiers might be injured and he wished to
rout the enemy with as little damage as possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have it! I have it!” exclaimed the General one
morning as he sat studying the tiny map. “We can hire
a mole to tunnel under the wild men’s fort and then we
can blow it up with a firecracker.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bully!” shouted the Old Soldier. “And before they
get over the surprise of the explosion we can charge
through the destroyed fort into the village.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s the idea,” smiled the General. “We’ll go over
to-morrow and engage the old mole who lives down by
the river.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Moles are great engineers,” said the Doctor, “and
what they don’t know about underground digging isn’t
worth knowing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The next day the General and the Doctor, with an
escort of four soldiers, set out on the journey to the mole’s
home.</p>

<p class='c004'>“S-s-say, what is a m-m-mole anyhow?” asked the
Dunce as the little party marched along.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A mole? Why, a mole—let’s see, a mole—why a
mole is a mole,” answered Gogo.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll tell you what a mole is like,” laughed the Doctor,
who had overheard the Dunce’s question. “A mole is an
animal almost the size of a rat and he lives under the
ground. He has very small eyes and ears, and he very seldom
comes out in the day time, for it is pretty hard for him
to see in the bright sunlight. He has very short and powerful
legs with which he can dig very fast. He lives on
worms and grubs and roots, and he is usually very gruff
and bad-tempered.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently the little party came to the place where the
mole lived and the General ordered the soldiers to halt.
They had stopped by the side of a steep bank and near
the top was a hole under the roots of a tree, which was
the front door of the mole’s home.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dress up in line, men!” commanded the General,
“and when Mr. Mole comes to the door of his house I want
you all to present arms, for we will have to use the greatest
diplomacy in order to engage this fellow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The General stepped up near the bank and called
loudly several times into the hole and presently a long
furry nose appeared in the opening.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, what do you mean by awakening honest people
out of a sound sleep?” growled the mole. “What is it?
What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I beg your pardon,” said the General as he lifted his
hat and made a low bow; “I’m awfully sorry I disturbed
your rest, but having heard of your reputation as an engineer
I have come to beg your services for the Teenie
Weenie army. We want to engage you to dig a trench
for us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll work for four fat white grubs a day and not a
grub less,” snapped the mole.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i082.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>“That’s quite satisfactory,” answered the General.
“We are willing to pay whatever you ask, but I want you
to know just what the work will be. We want you to dig
a tunnel in the ground so we can explode a mine in it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t care a snap of my tail what kind of work it
is; all I want is my pay,” growled the mole.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When may we expect you?” asked the General.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-morrow at four o’clock, not a minute sooner or
later,” answered the mole.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shall we have breakfast for you?” asked the General.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, certainly! Why, certainly!” exclaimed the mole.
“How in the name of angleworms do you expect me to
work without food? What do you suppose I’m workin’
for—pleasure?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll have a couple of nice young grubs for you,” said
the General politely, although he was quite disturbed by
the mole’s ungentlemanly manner.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Two grubs and a couple of angleworms would make
me work better,” suggested the mole.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You shall have them,” answered the General stiffly.
“Good day to you, sir.” Lifting his hat politely, he ordered
the soldiers to march back to camp.</p>

  <h2 id='ch19' class='c007'>Chapter Nineteen<br /> <br />THE OLD SOLDIER’S WAR MACHINE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>At exactly four o’clock the next morning the mole
came into camp, and as the General had promised,
his breakfast was ready. After the mole had eaten his
grubs, he reported for work. The General showed the
mole just where he wanted the tunnel to run and immediately
the old fellow set to work. He burrowed his nose
down into the soft ground and then pushed the loosened
earth back with his powerful fore claws. He worked wonderfully
fast and in less than a minute he had entirely
disappeared into the ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>All day long the mole worked, coming out only for a
few minutes at noon to eat his lunch, and at half past five
in the afternoon he again appeared to announce that the
tunnel had been finished.</p>

<p class='c004'>The General sent the Sailor into the tunnel to measure
it, for he wanted to be quite sure that it reached a point
just under the wild men’s fort.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s just exactly eight hundred and fifty-eight feet
long,” announced the Sailor when he crawled out of the
tunnel a few minutes later. “I could hear the wild men
walking on the ground above, so it must stop right in the
middle of the fort.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Course it does,” snapped the mole. “Don’t you suppose
I know how to dig?”</p>

<p class='c004'>When the mole had been paid for his work, he slipped
off into the night without ever even thanking the Teenie
Weenies for his pay.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Queer old surly fellow,” said the General as he
watched the awkward mole waddle off.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, but you have to admit that he is a wonderful engineer,”
observed the Old Soldier.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, gentlemen,” said the General turning to his officers,
“we have got to move our lines forward. You see,
we are about eight hundred and fifty feet from the wild
men’s fort and it is quite necessary that trenches be built
forward so we will not have too great a distance to charge
when we explode the mine under the enemy’s fort.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The officers all agreed with the General and that very
night several men were sent out, when it was quite dark,
to start the work.</p>

<p class='c004'>The little soldiers had gone but a short distance when
they were seen by the wild men, who sent a shower of
arrows at them, and Gogo was slightly scratched on the
arm, while one of the wild men’s arrows splintered the
Old Soldier’s wooden leg, so the General ordered the work
stopped for the time being.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Old Soldier was quite an engineer and when he
had whittled out a new wooden leg, he set to work trying
to scheme out some way by which the men could dig
the trenches without being hit by the wild men’s arrows.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have it,” he cried after he had puzzled over the matter
for a time. “We can make a big screen out of sticks,
one that is quite arrow-proof.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How are you going to move it?” asked the Turk.
“It will be too heavy for the men to carry.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i086.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>“That will be easy,” smiled the Old Soldier. “There’s
a spool of thread among our supplies and all we have to
do is to remove the thread and—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Use the spool as a sort of wheel to roll the screen
on,” put in the Cook.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Right,” laughed the Old Soldier. “We can push it
ahead of us on the spool and be quite safe from the wild
men’s arrows.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The General ordered the screen made and at once, under
the watchful eye of the Old Soldier, the men set to
work building it. In a remarkably short time the screen
was finished and early the next morning the Old Soldier,
with six chosen men, started to push it toward the wild
men’s fort.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i087.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>As soon as the wild men saw the screen coming toward
them, they let fly a shower of arrows, but they either
stuck fast in the screen or flew harmlessly over the soldier’s
heads.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great Guns!” cried the Old Soldier when the little
party had pushed the screen quite a ways toward the wild
men’s fort. “We forgot to bring along the picks and
shovels.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll get ’em, Captain,” said the Dunce, saluting
the Old Soldier and hardly waiting for the officer’s permission,
the Dunce ran for the trench which they had
just left, as fast as his legs would carry him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Dunce grabbed up three picks and with the help
of the Chinaman who volunteered to go along, the two
brave Teenie Weenies ran for the screen amid the flying
arrows which whizzed all about them.</p>

<p class='c004'>All day long the men worked hard, pulling the screen
along as they dug back toward the Teenie Weenie trench,
and at night, six other soldiers took up the work where the
rest left off. Several days of hard labor finished the work
and not one Teenie Weenie had been shot, thanks to the
Old Soldier’s screen.</p>

</div>
<p class='c002'>From the new trenches the Teenie Weenies could see
the wild men’s fort plainly. The little soldiers had
to be very careful, however, for every time they showed
themselves the wild men would let fly a shower of arrows.
The soldiers thought it great fun to put their hats on
sticks and push them out in sight of the wild men. At first
this brought a tremendous number of arrows, but finally
the wild men caught onto the trick and only an occasional
arrow would fly at the exposed hat.</p>

<p class='c004'>The men took turns guarding the front trenches. It was
very tiresome work sitting in the narrow ditch waiting
for something to happen and most of the soldiers would
have welcomed the order to storm the wild men’s fort.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t see why the General doesn’t get busy and
take the fort,” growled the Scotchman one afternoon. Several
of the men, who were off duty, were lying in a mossy
place under some big ferns, discussing the matter.
“We’ve got everything ready for the attack, the men are
more than anxious to go into action and we could lick
the stuffin’ out of the Saboes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Keep cool, Scotty; we’ll get a chance soon enough,”
said the Turk, who was very quiet and always took things
calmly. “The General knows what he’s about and when
he gets his plans ready, we’ll get all the excitement we
want.”</p>

<div  class='figleft id008'>

</div>
<p class='c004'>“Excitement!” exclaimed the Dunce.
“That’s me. I’ve got to have some excitement;
I’m sick and tired of sittin’
around here without anything doin’.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s get our guns and go out and
see if we can’t shoot some dragon flies or
mosquitoes,” suggested the Sailor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nah, that ain’t dangerous enough,”
answered the Dunce. “I want to do
something that will give me a thrill,” and
getting up he slowly walked towards the
tall grass near the Teenie Weenie camp.</p>

<p class='c004'>The General had given orders that
none of the soldiers should leave camp,
for the grass was so tangled and thick
that it would be an easy thing to get lost
and, besides, the savage wild men might
be hiding behind the thick stalks of
grass.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jinks!” thought the Dunce as he
peered into the dense grass, “the General
wouldn’t scold me if I happened to
stroll out there and capture a wild man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>After some minutes of thought, the
Dunce hurried to his tent, got his gun
and sneaked unseen out of camp into the
dark grass. He stumbled along for some
time without making much headway, for the stalks of
grass grew close together and the dead leaves tangled
about his feet at almost every step. Presently he came to an
open spot near the edge of the island, where he found
walking much easier, but he had gone only a short distance
when he suddenly saw four wild men ahead of him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Throw up your hands—you’re surrounded!” shouted
the Dunce, pointing his gun towards them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wild men, not understanding the Teenie Weenie
language, started running towards the Dunce with loud
yells.</p>

<p class='c004'>The poor Dunce was so badly frightened he forgot to
fire his gun and turning about he ran as fast as his short
legs could carry him towards the Teenie Weenie camp.</p>

<p class='c004'>The army aviator, who happened to be scouting above
the shore of the island, saw the Dunce being chased by
the wild men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quick!” he shouted to the bird on which he flew.
“Fly just as close as you can to the Dunce and I’ll grab
him as we sail by.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The bird flew straight for the ground and holding
tight to its neck, the aviator grabbed the Dunce by the
collar and snatched him from the very hands of the
wild men.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Turk pulled the frightened Dunce up on the
bird’s back and a few minutes later they landed safely
in the Teenie Weenie camp.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, sir,” said the General when he had heard the
Turk’s story of the rescue, “what were you doing outside
the camp without permission to go out?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I-I-I-I j-j-just wanted s-s-some excitement and I-I-I-I
thought I’d go out and s-s-see if I-I-I couldn’t capture a
wild man,” stammered the frightened Dunce.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, did you capture any of them?” asked the General
with a wink at the Old Soldier.</p>

<p class='c004'>“W-w-w-well, I-I surrounded f-f-four of ’em, but they
wouldn’t stay surrounded and they started to chase me,
so I-I-I had to r-r-run.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, did you get any excitement?” smiled the
General.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, yes, sir, I-I-I got more than I-I-I was looking for.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, sir,” said the General, “I hope you got enough
excitement to last you for a long time. You are guilty of
an act of leaving camp without permission and I find it
necessary to place you under arrest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The poor Dunce was marched off between four soldiers
to the tiny guard house, where he was left to think
over his disobedience.</p>

  <h2 id='ch21' class='c007'>Chapter Twenty-One<br /> <br />THE SCOUTS HAVE A NARROW ESCAPE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>“General, the men are getting restless. They want
to get into action and it seems to me that we ought
to hurry our plans for the attack,” said the Old Soldier.
The two little officers were sitting at the tiny table in front
of the General’s tent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I believe you’re right,” answered the General
thoughtfully. “The plans for the attack are almost ready,
but I would like to get some more information about the
wild men. I’d like to know just how many are guarding
the fort, what sort of arms they have and a lot of other
details. The Turk has been able to get much valuable
information, but the grass is so tall around the fort that
he has not been able to get very near in the airplane, so
I’m afraid I’ll have to send the scouts out for the facts I
want.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s mighty dangerous,” said the Old Soldier,
stroking his beard. “The jungle is full of the Saboes—they
are swarming all through the grass, thicker than
ants on a chocolate drop.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I know it’s dangerous, but I believe the Cowboy
and the Indian can get through unseen and bring back
the information I want,” the General said. “Either one
of the little fellows is at home in the woods and grass.
They are both pastmasters in covering up their tracks.
Why, I believe the Indian could walk through a lady’s
powder box without ever leaving a single track,” and the
General said it so earnestly there was no doubt but that
he spoke the truth.</p>

<p class='c004'>Turning to the guard that stood near his tent, the
General ordered him to bring the Indian and the Cowboy.
“Tell them it is important and that I wish them to
report at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In a few minutes the two scouts appeared and, clicking
their tiny heels together, they saluted in the most
approved military fashion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You sent for us, sir?” said the Cowboy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” answered the General, looking seriously at the
sturdy little men. “I have a piece of work for you to do.
First I want to tell you that it is mighty risky—in fact, it
is extremely dangerous. I will not send you unless you
are willing to go—you shall choose.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We are ready to go,” answered the little scouts
quietly, and their loyalty touched the General greatly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I want you to go to the wild men’s fort and get all
the information you can,” said the General. “Find out
how many men they have, what sort of weapons they use,
note the condition of their fort and get some idea of the
ground beyond the fort. Get all the facts you can and
report to me as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir,” answered the scouts and, saluting, they hurried
to their tent, where they buckled on their tiny pistols.
Next they each secured a supply of dried minnow
and half a boiled bean, which they stuffed into their
pockets.</p>

<p class='c004'>They slipped quietly out of camp and after a long and
tiresome trip they finally drew near to the wild men’s
fort. They could hear the voices of the wild men now and
then and the two Teenie Weenies were forced to steal
along with the greatest care. Presently they crawled up
to a place quite near the fort where they could see the
wild men every now and then through the long grass.
The scouts watched the wild men for several hours and it
was quite late before the little fellows could find a chance
to crawl away safely and unseen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several times on their way back to the Teenie Weenie
camp the scouts were forced to hide under leaves and dry
grass to keep from being discovered, and once they had
to lie for almost an hour in a hollow stick, as several wild
men stopped near them to rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It be heap much dark soon,” grunted the Indian as
he peered through the grass at the sky.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We can never get back to camp before night and we
couldn’t possibly get through this jungle in the dark, so
we’ve got to find some place to spend the night,” whispered
the Cowboy.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two Teenie Weenies found a deserted bird’s nest
in a bush near by, and, climbing up the bush, they soon
made themselves comfortable for the night.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i098.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>Early in the morning the little scouts were awakened
by voices, and looking over the edge of the nest, they saw
several wild men coming towards the bush. The wild men
stopped beneath the bush, where they soon made a fire
and cooked pieces of frog ham for their breakfast.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two Teenie Weenies had eaten what little food
they had brought with them the day before and as they
smelled the delicious meat cooking it made them as hungry
as bears. There were too many of the Saboes for the
two scouts to fight, so they could do nothing but lie quiet
until the wild men had gone. In a short time the wild men
finished their breakfast and after talking in their strange
language for a few minutes they hurried away.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the wild men had disappeared into the jungle of
tall grass near by, the two scouts carefully climbed out of
the nest and set off in the direction of the Teenie Weenie
camp. Several times they had to hide behind sticks and
leaves when the wild men passed near them, and once,
three of the savage little fellows came so close to the spot
where the scouts lay hidden that they thought they would
surely be discovered. It was almost evening before the
Cowboy and the Indian reached camp and the little fellows
reported at once to the General. They gave the
Commander of the Teenie Weenie army such valuable
news that he at once called in his staff for a council of war.</p>

<p class='c004'>The little officers talked for a long time and when they
finally came out of the General’s tent, it was very plain to
see that something was about to happen. Officers dashed
about the camp giving orders, the Doctor and the two
nurses busied themselves around the tiny hospital, while
Paddy Pinn spent much time with his Teenie Weenie
cannon.</p>

<p class='c004'>Three of the soldiers carried two big firecrackers into
the tunnel the mole had made. In fact, everyone was busy
and the whole camp teemed with excitement, wondering
as to what was to happen next.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c007'>Chapter Twenty-Two<br /> <br />THE BATTLE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>Orders had been given to attack the wild men in
the morning and most of the Teenie Weenie soldiers
slept very little during the night. At daylight a thimbleful
of hot cocoa and a supply of bread was brought into
the front trenches and while the little soldiers ate, the
artillery kept up a heavy fire on the wild men’s fort.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last the order was given to charge and the excited
Teenie Weenies climbed out of their trenches and dashed
for the fort.</p>

<p class='c004'>Although the soldiers’ tiny knees knocked together
and their teeth chattered with fright,
they went into battle with great
eagerness, cheered by the voices of
several meadow mice and bugs, who
stood out of range of the wild men’s
arrows.</p>

<div  class='figleft id008'>
<img src='images/i101.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>It was a great victory. Probably
the history of the battle can be better
told by one who took part in it, so we
shall hear the story from a letter written
by Mr. Lover to his wife immediately
after the battle. The tiny letter
was written on a piece of very thin birch bark, about half
the size of a postage stamp, but if you could see it under
a powerful microscope you would read it, word for
word, just as it appears on this page.</p>

<p class='c011'>My dear Bab:</p>
<p class='c013'>As the Indian is carrying the official news of the battle
back to Shoehurst, you will know before you open this letter
that we have won. It was wonderful and I will tell you all
about it from the very first. The wild men’s fort, which was
made of strong sticks, lay in a narrow path guarding the only
open road to the village, where the Lady of Fashion and Poet
are held prisoners. In order to get to the village we had to
capture the fort. We heard the night before that we were to
storm the fort in the morning and believe me, we didn’t sleep
much; that is, I didn’t. I was as nervous as a cat in a dog
house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early in the morning the aviator flew over the fort and
dropped pepper bombs. These bombs are made out of red
pepper tied up in thin pieces of tissue paper and when they
hit the ground they break and scatter the pepper all around.
While the wild men were sneezing from the effects of the
pepper, the artillery opened up and sent a lot of shot into
the fort.</p>

<p class='c013'>Next, a big mine we had made under the fort was exploded.
There were two big firecrackers in it and, say, you
ought to have seen the sticks fly up in the air when that mine
went off! Right after the mine explosion we were ordered
to charge and we jumped out of the trenches and started on
the run for the fort.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id015'>

<p><span class='color_blue'><span class='sc'>The Teenie Weenie Army Drives the Wild Men from their WRECKED FORT.</span>—<i>Chapter Twenty-two.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We were almost halfway there when the Sailor, who was
carrying the flag, dropped with an arrow in his chest. The
Dunce caught up the fallen flag and putting his hat on top of
the staff, he yelled for us to follow. Everybody cheered, for
we didn’t think the Dunce had enough nerve to do such a
brave thing.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fort was badly wrecked by the explosion, so it wasn’t
hard to climb over it to get at the wild men. Most of the
Saboes were so scared they never tried to fight, but a few of
them stood their ground. They were quickly subdued, however.
We captured fourteen men; five of them are wounded,
but the Doctor has them in the hospital and he’ll fix them
up all right.</p>

<p class='c013'>Four of our men were wounded, but the Sailor is the
only one who was badly hurt. The Doctor says that he will
pull through all right.</p>

<p class='c013'>We wanted to attack the wild men’s village, but the General
wouldn’t let us. He says we have got to take care of
the wounded and make our lines safe before we can go farther.
Some of the men seem to think that there will be very
little fight left in the wild men, for they were pretty well
scared by our attack. The Scotchman and I are doing
guard duty; we have to guard the prisoners. We are using
an old bottle for a prison and it certainly makes a good one;
if we keep on getting prisoners we’ll soon have a bottleful.</p>

<p class='c013'>I do hope the General follows up the victory and goes
right after these wild men, so we can end this war, for I
want to get home to you and the children.</p>

<p class='c013'>Well, I’ll have to stop now as the Indian is about ready
to start for Shoehurst. Tell the twins I have a nice string
of blackberry seed beads for each of them and give them each
a kiss for me.</p>
<p class='c018'>Affectionately,</p>
<p class='c014'>Your Husband.</p>

<p class='c013'>P. S.: The Cook and the Chinaman have just brought
up a pot of cocoa and four hot beans! Hurrah! we’re going
to have a feast.</p>

</div>
<p class='c002'>There was much confusion after the battle, for so
many things had to be done, and done quickly.
The lines had to be advanced and made safe against attack
by the wild men. The prisoners had to be carefully
guarded until they could be put into the grape juice bottle
which was being used as a prison.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, there were the wounded. Both Teenie Weenies
and wild men had to be given the best of care. Just as soon
as the battle was over, the injured were gathered up and
carried tenderly to the Red Cross field hospital, where
the Doctor and his two little nurses dressed their wounds.
The Clown and the Policeman carried the wounded into
the hospital on tiny stretchers and just as soon as the
injured little fellows had medical care, they were put into
clean beds. At first the injured wild men were much
frightened, but when they were handled so tenderly by
the Doctor and his lovely nurses, they became quite
contented.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Doctor’s official report to the General gives the
best idea of the work of the Red Cross after the battle,
and it is printed here, word for word, from that tiny
document.</p>

</div>
<p class='c002'>After the battle the front lines were moved quite a
distance towards the center of the island, where
the wild men’s village stood. A strong breastwork of
sticks and grass was built and a most careful watch was
kept at all times. Nothing was seen of the wild men
except shadowy forms that every now and then dodged
about among the stalks of big grass. They were surely
in the tall grass, for the savage little fellows could slip
about in the jungle almost unseen.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was quite certain that the General intended to move
again in a short time, for everything was made ready
for another battle.</p>

<p class='c004'>One morning the Scotchman, who was in the front
lines, happened to see a wild man crawling along on his
stomach towards a stick that lay in front of the Teenie
Weenie breastwork. The tiny soldier raised his gun and
waited, thinking the wild men were about to charge, but
instead a blade of grass appeared above the stick and to
it was tied a white rag.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jinks!” exclaimed the Scotchman, lowering his gun,
“the wild men are showing a flag of truce.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hold your fire, men!” shouted the Cowboy, who
was in charge of the Teenie Weenie fort at the time.
“They are sending out a flag of truce.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently the wild man crawled out from behind the
stick and timidly made his way toward the Teenie
Weenies.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you want?” asked the Cowboy, peering
over the top of the fort.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wap gee goo mah be gum,” answered the wild man
as he approached the Teenie Weenies. Of course none
of them could understand a word of this.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id017'>
<img src='images/i111.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Talk English, you goof,” cried the Cowboy. “I
can’t understand that kind of talk.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The wild man carried a piece of folded birch bark in
his hand and when he reached the fort he handed it over
to the Cowboy. It was addressed to the General, and the
Cowboy at once sent the note to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the note was delivered to the General, he found
that it was from the Queen of the wild men, written by
the Poet, and this is what he read:</p>
<p class='c011'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Commander in Chief,
Teenie Weenie Army.
My dear General:</p>
<p class='c013'>Her Royal Highness, Mooie, Queen of the wild men, sends
greetings. Her Highness wishes to talk over terms of peace
with you and suggests that you and your staff meet her at the
stream which crosses the path halfway between the Sabo village
and your camp. Her Highness awaits your pleasure and
asks Your Excellency to set a date for the meeting.</p>
<p class='c018'>Respectfully yours</p>
<p class='c014'>RUFUS RHYME.</p>

<p class='c013'>P. S.—Although the Lady of Fashion and I have been
closely guarded since we have been prisoners, we have been
very well treated and I ask that you take this into consideration
when you arrange peace terms.</p>
<p class='c018'>R. R.</p>

<p class='c017'>The General answered the note at once, making
arrangements to meet the Queen on the following day.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next day at the appointed time the General, the
Old Soldier and a guard of eight soldiers marched off to
the meeting place, where they found the Queen awaiting
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Queen sat on her favorite turtle and she had with
her several of her warriors and the Poet.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i113.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>As the Teenie Weenies drew near, the Queen and her
followers raised their left hands above their heads, which
is the Sabo custom when friends meet. The Queen was
the first to speak, and the Poet, who had learned the Sabo
language while he was held prisoner, translated her
words to the Teenie Weenies as follows:</p>

<p class='c004'>“O, great chief of the thunder wagon (the name, “Men
of the Thunder Wagon,” was given to the Teenie Weenies
on account of the cannon which the wild men said
sounded like thunder), we have come here to ask for
peace. We do not wish to fight; we ask only for the liberty
of our brothers whom you hold prisoners. Give us
back our brothers and we will return the Lady of Fashion
and the Poet to you. We will also give you two hundred
smoked frog hams for our brothers’ return.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“O queen of beauty and ruler of all the Saboes,” said
the General when the Poet had finished, “we do not wish
to fight, and we ask only for the return of our friends. For
their safe return we will free your brothers. The hams
you have offered we could not think of taking, for we took
up arms against you, not for gain, but only for the freedom
of the Lady of Fashion and the Poet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Queen was greatly pleased at the General’s words
and arrangements were made for the exchange of the prisoners.</p>

<p class='c004'>That same day all the wild men, except the ones who
were in the hospital and who were too sick to leave, were
set free.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>They were taken, under guard of several soldiers, to
the stream where the General had met the Queen. The
Lady of Fashion and the Poet were waiting for them and
the Teenie Weenie soldiers gave three mighty cheers
when they saw their friends. The prisoners were exchanged
and the Lady of Fashion and the Poet were
taken to the Teenie Weenie camp, where they were
given a royal welcome.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Lady of Fashion was so happy to be again among
her friends that she did a very ladylike thing—she cried.
The nurses cried and several of the men were seen to blow
their tiny noses and blink their eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I’m so happy to be safe with you all again,”
cried the Lady of Fashion as she hugged the General for
the tenth time. “I don’t know what those nasty wild men
captured us for, we never could find out, but I will say for
them that they were very good to us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we are mighty glad to have you with us again,”
said the General. “And it’s through the loyalty of every
soldier in our army that your rescue has been accomplished.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know it. I know it,” cried the little lady, and she
hugged every single man in the army except the Chinaman,
who was so embarrassed that he ran off and hid in a
hollow log for nearly an hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two nurses took the Lady of Fashion to their
tent, where she washed until she was as clean as a drop
of dew.</p>

<p class='c004'>That night the army gathered around a roaring bonfire
and eagerly listened to the Poet while he told them
how he and the Lady of Fashion had spent their time
as prisoners of the wild men. When he had finished, the
little people sang songs, told stories and gossiped until
after midnight, when the General ordered everyone to
bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s so nice to sleep in a clean, honest-to-goodness
bed again,” said the Lady of Fashion when she crawled
into one of the tiny cots in the nurses’ tent, but she didn’t
sleep a great deal, for the three little women had so
much to talk about. They whispered and giggled until
early morning.</p>

  <h2 id='ch25' class='c007'>Chapter Twenty-Five<br /> <br />THE PEACE DANCE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>“Well, folks,” announced the General the next
morning as he sat down to breakfast with several
of his officers, the Lady of Fashion and the Poet, “we
must make ready for the march home. We have a long
journey ahead of us and we must get started as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t see how we can,” answered the Doctor, who
was helping himself to a piece of frog ham. “The
Sailor is in no condition to be moved and, besides, I still
have a couple of the wild men on my hands, who are
in such shape I can’t leave them for a few days.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s so! That’s so!” exclaimed the General. “Of
course we’ll have to stay until our duty is done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My patients are all doing well and I don’t see why
we won’t be able to get away in five or six days,” said
the Doctor.</p>

<p class='c004'>The little soldiers were greatly disappointed when
they heard that the army would not start immediately
for home, for now that the war was over they were all
anxious to return. However, they made the best of their
time by fishing, swimming and playing games.</p>

<p class='c004'>One morning a sentinel came to the General’s tent,
followed by one of the wild men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This fellow has a message for you,” said the sentinel
pointing to the wild man, who held a piece of folded
birch bark in his hand. “There are about twenty-five
more of ’em waiting out beyond our lines and they’ve
each got a big bundle all wrapped up in leaves.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The General opened the note which the wild man
handed him, but when he found it was written in the
Sabo language he sent for the Poet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll have to translate this gibberish for me,” said
the General when the Poet appeared. “It’s too much
for me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Poet carefully read the note and then repeated
it to the General.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s from the Queen and she is sending you greetings
and some presents,” said the Poet. “She also invites
you to the great Dance of Peace and Plenty. This
is the dance the wild men dance whenever they make
peace with their enemies. You must go to the dance,
for that is the way the wild men have of showing that
they want to be friendly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” answered the General; “tell her I’ll come.
Thank her for the presents and give her my regards.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A number of soldiers were sent out to bring in the
presents the Queen had sent and when they were unwrapped
the little people were surprised to find a number
of fat frog hams, a quantity of wild rice, a large jar
of fruit paste made out of wild berries, many nut meats
and sweet seeds.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We ought to send a present to the Queen in return
for all this food,” said the General. “What shall we send
her?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Send her that thimble the Dunce ruined trying to
make a suit of armor,” answered the Poet, who had heard
the story of the Dunce’s armor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not that old thimble!” exclaimed the General.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure,” laughed the Poet. “She will think that it is
wonderful!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i121.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>So the thimble was sent to the Queen, who prized it
more than anything else she owned.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the appointed day the General set off for the
dance with a number of the Teenie Weenies, and as they
drew near the village they were met by a body of wild
men who had been sent out as a guard of honor to escort
the General into the village. He was led to a spot beneath
a big bush where the Queen sat cross-legged on a wonderfully
soft piece of cloth which had been thrown on
the ground. Over her head hung another cloth which
was fastened at the four corners to long poles held in the
hands of four wild men.</p>

<p class='c004'>A great many wild men and women stood about an
open spot under the bush, which had been swept until
it was as clean as a pin. Many children ran about the
place, some of them climbing onto the grass houses and
into the trees. On the edge of the crowd stood several
small animals, and some birds were perched in the bush
overhead.</p>

<p class='c004'>The General made a low bow to the Queen and when
she motioned for him to sit by her side, he sat down on
the soft cloth. The Queen and the General talked for
some time through the Poet, who translated for them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently the Queen gave a command to one of her
warriors and instantly several men, who were sitting on
the ground in front of the Queen, began to beat on
drums. The drums were made out of a piece of hollow
reed. The ends were covered with snake skin and they
made a very pretty, mellow sound. Another man beat
on a piece of wood which had been fixed to a split reed,
while three or four women beat paddles together in
time with the music.</p>

<p class='c004'>Instantly a number of voices broke into a loud song
from behind a house near by and presently the dancers
came hopping and prancing into the cleared spot
before the Queen. First came a warrior with a long
spear and when he danced directly in front of the Queen
he broke the spear in two over his knee. Next came a
man with a queer seed pod over his head and in one
hand he carried a whip with which he struck the warrior
every now and then. In the other hand he carried
a dried seed pod which rattled loudly in time with the
song. The next dancer wore a frog’s head and hopped
in time with the music, much after the fashion of a frog.
Several girls followed the frog man, carrying plates of
smoked frog ham and rice cakes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The first man in the dance,” explained the Poet to
the General, “is the Spirit of War. He broke the spear
to show you that the war was over and the next man
rattled the seed pod and struck him with the whip to
scare him away, which means that the wild men are
through with war and wish to get rid of the War Spirit.
The frog man represents the frog meat which the wild
men eat, and his funny dance means that good times are
coming, for you see the pretty girls follow with plates
of rice cakes and meat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The dancers performed for several minutes and then
the man with the whip and rattle chased the Spirit of
War over the hill out of sight, which meant that the
Spirit of War was gone for good.</p>

<p class='c004'>After the dance a great fire was built and when a
heap of hot ashes had burned, the wild men wrapped
several frog hams in sassafras leaves and put them into
the hot bed of ashes to roast. When the hams were cooked
they were cut into slices and served to the Teenie Weenies
and the wild men. Wonderfully delicious rice cakes
were also served and the Teenie Weenies ate until they
were quite filled. The greedy Dunce ate so much he
became quite ill and had to be carried back to the Teenie
Weenie camp, where the Doctor was kept busy most
of the night putting heated buttons on his aching
tummy, until the pain was gone.</p>

<p class='c017'>The Teenie Weenie soldiers sang this song as they
sat about their tiny camp fire one evening shortly
after the peace dance. They were all happy, for they
were to start for home in the morning. The Sailor was
now well enough to stand the long trip and that was all
that had been holding them back.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He can stand the trip,” the Doctor said, “if he is carried
in some way that will not jolt him. He was badly
wounded and I wouldn’t care to have him ride in one
of the army wagons, as they are much too rough.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We can make a litter and get two mice to carry it,”
suggested Tess Bone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s a good idea,” said the Doctor. “He will rest
that way in fine shape.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Turk and the Old Soldier agreed to make the
litter and in a short time they had built such a cozy one
the Sailor was quite pleased with it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Crickety!” exclaimed the Dunce when he saw the litter,
“I wish I was wounded so I could ride in that instead
of walkin’ all the way home.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i126.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>The army wagons were loaded and early in the morning
the little army began the long journey home. First
the cannon and then the baggage and wagons had to
be moved across the river on the raft. It took the little
people all day to move across the river, for many trips
had to be made with the clumsy raft. But at the end of
the day not a single Teenie Weenie was left on Sabo
Island.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Queen Mooie had given the Teenie Weenies so
many presents of frog hams, rice cakes, delicious seeds
and many hickory nut meats, the little people were well
supplied with good food. Every evening after the day’s
march the happy little army ate their meal gathered
around a glowing camp fire. They laughed and joked,
sang songs, told stories and gossiped with the many
birds and animals of the woods who gathered about the
camp fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>Often the Teenie Weenies listened to a strange tale of
the forest, told by some owl or chipmunk, and quite
often the birds sang to them.</p>

<p class='c004'>One evening a wicked old weasel came prowling
around the camp. The little folks were quite alarmed
about it, for the old fellow hung around for a long time.
They could see his wicked green eyes shining in the
light from the camp fire and when the General asked
him what he wanted, he never answered. At last the
General told several of the soldiers to fire off their rifles.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shoot in the air over his head and give him a good
scare,” ordered the General. “I think that will fix him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At the first sound of the guns the weasel quickly disappeared
into the night and nothing more was seen of
him, although the men kept a mighty close watch for
several days.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the army came to the place where they had
built the bridge, they found the squirrel whom they had
hired to guard it, on duty.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, here I am,” shouted the squirrel. “And here is
the bridge just as you left it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have done your duty well,” said the General,
and he ordered the Cook to pay the squirrel the ten sunflower
seeds and the hickory nuts which had been promised
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I always believe in doin’ my duty,” said the
squirrel. “If I agree to do a thing I always stick to my
word—I’d rather lose every whisker I’ve got than go
back on my word.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A bluejay who was sitting in a bush near by snickered
and the squirrel gave him a nasty look. The Teenie
Weenies thought for a minute that there might be
a quarrel, but the bluejay flew off, so they felt much
easier.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a pleasant talk with the squirrel, the General
ordered the army to march on and as long as the Teenie
Weenies were in sight the squirrel waved to them
from the top of an old stump.</p>

<p class='c004'>The trip seemed to agree with the Sailor. He grew
stronger and stronger under the watchful eye of the Doctor
and the two dainty nurses. He was fed on broth and
a tiny bit of poached bird’s egg each day, and as the
army drew near home he was almost strong enough to
walk.</p>

<p class='c004'>One day the Teenie Weenies were surprised to hear
a bird shout to them from a bush over their heads and
when they looked up they saw it was Tilly Titter, the
English Sparrow—an old and trusted friend.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of course the General ordered a halt, while the men
gathered around the sparrow and asked many questions.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How are the twins?” asked Mr. Lover.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fine! Just fine!” cried the bird. “I was over to the
village yesterday and they were playin’ foot ball with
a gooseberry. They are as husky as a caterpillar in a
mulberry bush. Your wife is as fat as butter; I’ll bet she
has gained half an ounce since you left her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>After the Teenie Weenies had learned all the news
from home the General gave a message to Tilly and
asked her to deliver it to the Teenie Weenie village.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can just bet your last fish worm I’ll carry that
message as quick as I can,” said the bird. “Everyone in
the village will be tickled to death to hear that you are
so near home. Grandpa will be so ’appy ’e’ll shout
’imself ’oarse.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Spreading her wings, Tilly Titter flew into the air and
quickly disappeared in the direction of the Teenie Weenie
village.</p>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch27' class='c007'>Chapter Twenty-seven<br /> <br />THE GRAND REVIEW</h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>Tilly Titter flew as she never flew
before and in a short time she
landed on the ground beside the shoe
house, her feathers all ruffled up with
excitement.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got news,” she shouted, as the
little women gathered about her. “I’ve
just come from the General
and the army will be home
in about three days.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i130.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Is my husband well?”
shouted Mrs. Lover.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s as healthy as a
dandelion and as pink as a rose bud,” answered Tilly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How’s the Poet and the Lady of Fashion?” asked
Grandpa.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well and ’appy,” cried Tilly. “As I was a sayin’,
the army will be ’ome in about three days. The General
said to tell you that they would arrive on Friday afternoon
if everthing goes well. He says for you to have a
good supper ready for the boys and to have plenty, for
they will be as hungry as young robins.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is the Sailor getting along nicely?” asked Miss Guff.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fine as a fiddle! Fine as a fiddle!” answered the
sparrow. “Wants to walk, ’e’s feelin’ so well, but the Doctor
makes ’im stay in the litter and ride.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we have got to get busy and do somethin’ for
the boys,” cried Grandpa. “We’ve got to give ’em a big
feed and decorate the place with flags and show ’em
we’re glad to see ’em.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll get up a grand supper for them,” cried Mrs.
Lover, “and we’ll have a dance afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll bring over a big chunk of cheese,” cried the
mouse that had joined the crowd.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll get some fat worms for the supper,” cried Tilly,
and instantly she blushed a deep brown. “Oh, I forget
you don’t eat worms. Well, I’ll get some sunflower seeds.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll donate a few nuts,” said Nick, the squirrel, who
had been hoping for a chance to speak.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I forgot to say that the General said ’e would
come in ahead of the army so ’e could review them as
they marched into the village,” cried Tilly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s going to review the troops, did you say?” asked
Grandpa, who was hard of hearing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes!” shouted Tilly, right into the old gentleman’s
ear. “The General is goin’ to review the army.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we got to get a reviewing stand ready for him,”
cried Grandpa.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll help,” shouted the mouse, “and I’ll get some mice
to help, too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right, get ’em!” cried Grandpa. “The sooner we
get to work the better it will be.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In a short time the Teenie Weenies were as busy as
bees in a clover field. The little women set to work cooking
and baking. They made cakes and cookies by the
thimble full. They made ginger cookies, nut cookies,
chocolate cake, fruit cake and half an English walnut full
of doughnuts, besides all sorts of other good things.</p>

<p class='c004'>Grandpa put eight mice, a chipmunk and half a dozen
bugs to work getting the place ready for the returning
soldiers. They cleaned up the rubbish under the rose-bush,
they moved all the desks out of the schoolhouse,
where the dinner and dance were to be held, and they
made a reviewing stand out of the top of a candy box.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nick, the squirrel, worked hard opening nuts. He
gnawed so many his teeth became sore, but he never complained,
for he was a very patriotic squirrel and most fond
of the Teenie Weenies.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i133.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>The little folks decorated the village with Teenie
Weenie flags and bunting and when the time arrived for
the army to march home the village was crowded with
all sorts of visitors. Bugs, mice, squirrels, birds, chipmunks,
and even a few chickens and ducks, crowded
under the rose-bush.</p>

<p class='c004'>The General rode in ahead of the army and took his
place on the reviewing stand amid the wildest shouting
and waving of flags, but when the troops came marching
into view there was such a squealing of squirrels and
mice and squawking of chickens, ducks and birds, one
could hardly hear oneself think. Grandpa shouted so
hard that he had one of his choking fits, and a mouse
had to pound him on the back until he could get his
breath.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the review was over there was much hugging
and kissing and some crying, for most of the little women
shed a few tears of happiness, but that’s a strange way
women folks have of showing they are happy. One old
hen cried so hard she had to be led away. A duck insisted
on kissing the Dunce and a mouse hugged Paddy Pinn
so hard it nearly broke his arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>After the little soldiers had visited for a time they were
called into the old derby hat for supper and such a supper
as they had! There was roasted bird’s egg, frog ham,
escalloped hickory nut, walnut au gratin, creamed hearts
of sunflower seed, water cress and wild cherry salad, and
cakes and cookies and sliced grape and ice cream.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the little soldiers had eaten until they could not
hold another morsel, the General arose from his seat at
the head of the big table and made a speech.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Friends and men of the Teenie Weenie army,” he
began, “I want to thank you for your loyal and hearty
service. You have gone through hardships and you have
risked your lives in battle without complaint. You have
done this to aid those in trouble and nothing greater can
be said of your deeds than that they were done willingly.
Men, I am proud to have been your leader.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Three cheers for the army!” shouted a mouse who
had been helping to wait on table, and the cheers were
given with a will.</p>

<p class='c004'>Next the Lady of Fashion made a little speech. She
very prettily thanked the General and the army for having
rescued the Poet and herself from the wild men and
as she sat down there were tears in her pretty eyes. The
Poet spoke and Grandpa made a speech about the great
war in forty-two, but few heard what the old gentleman
said, for they were anxious to talk to one another about
the great events of the rescue of their friends.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Friends!” shouted Paddy Pinn, when Grandpa had
sat down, “I think the Dunce ought to explain to the rest
of us just why that old duck was so anxious to kiss him.”
Every one yelled so loudly for the Dunce that he was
forced to stand up, but he was so embarrassed he couldn’t
speak a word and the Teenie Weenies laughed so hard
they cried.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the tables had been cleared away the orchestra
started playing and in a few minutes the little folks were
swinging around to the music of “The Lady of Fashion
Waltz.” They danced until nearly morning—in fact it
was broad daylight when the tired little soldiers crawled
into their tiny beds, every one of them mighty thankful
that they were safely home again.</p>
